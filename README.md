Title: SecureWireless: Arduino-Based ECC-Encrypted Data Transmission
</br>

<br>
Introduction:

Welcome to SecureWireless, an innovative project that leverages Arduino and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to ensure secure and reliable wireless data transmission. This project enables you to seamlessly transmit data between two Arduinos while encrypting the information using ECC, providing a robust solution for privacy-conscious applications.
</br>
<br>
Features:
<ul>
<li>
1. **Wireless Connectivity:** Utilize the power of wireless communication between two Arduino devices, allowing for flexible and efficient data transfer without the hassle of physical connections.</li>
<li>
2. **ECC Encryption:** Elevate the security of your transmitted data with Elliptic Curve Cryptography. ECC is a cutting-edge cryptographic technique that ensures your information remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access.</li>
<li>
3. **User-Friendly Display:** The received data is elegantly displayed on a user-friendly interface, providing a convenient and clear view of the transmitted information.</li>
<li>
4. **Expandability:** Extend the capabilities of your project by seamlessly integrating additional devices. The third Arduino, equipped with the same RF module, effortlessly receives and displays the encrypted data, showcasing the project's scalability.
</li>
</ul>
